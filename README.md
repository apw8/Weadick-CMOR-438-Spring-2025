# CMOR 438 / INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository houses various fundamental concepts and algorithms of data science and machine learning taught during the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University by Dr. Randy R. Davila. Some of the topics covered include an introduction to scikit-learn, Keras and tensorflow2, linear and logistic regression, clustering, support vector machines, random forest trees, neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing.

### Content

This repository contains two main sub-repositories: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. Supervised Learning houses the following algorithms as sub-repositories: The Perceptron, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision and Regression Trees, Random Forests, and Other Ensemble Methods, including Bagging and Boosting. Unsupervised Learning houses the following algorithms as sub-repositories: K Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Label Propagation. Each sub-repository contains a README file, a .ipynb file in which the respective algorithms are implemented, and a sub-repository that houses the necessary datasets if applicable.
