# Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis is used in exploratory data analysis and for multidimensionality reduction. The main idea is to project data points onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the dataâ€™s variation as possible. In other words, using PCA we remove the redundant and highly-correlated data and we keep only the most significant data features for further analysis.

# Datasets

I used the palmer_penguins dataset, which is a dataset that contains information about the island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. It was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica.
