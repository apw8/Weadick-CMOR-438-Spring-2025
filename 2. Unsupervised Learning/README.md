# Unsupervised Learning

The key characteristic of Unsupervised Learning (in comparison to Supervised Learning) is that Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data and seeks to identify patterns in the unlabeled data. Some types of Unsupervised Learning include Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.

# Algorithms

The following algorithm are included in sub-repositories:
K Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis
Label Propagation
