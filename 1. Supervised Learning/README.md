# Supervised Learning

The key characteristic of Supervised Learning (in comparison to Unsupervised Learning) is that Supervised Learning deals with labels and seeks to map feature vectors to these target labels. There are two main types of Supervised Learning: Regression and Classification. Regression deals with real valued target labels while Classification deals with categorical target labels.
