# Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods are machine learning methods that aggregate the predictions of a group of base learners in order to form a single learning model. The average of their predictions is a much more accurate prediction than the individual predictions. Generally speaking, the models we pick for ensemble methods will be "dumb learners", meaning models that are barely superior to randomly guessing. Individually the models will perform poorly, but collectively will perform well. Some types of Ensemble Methods include Random Forests from the previous sub-directory, Hard Voting, Bagging, and Boosting.
