# Neural Networks

Neural Networks are computational graphs with an input layer, a sequence of hidden layers, and an output layer, with weights scaling inputs in between each layer. Each layer is comprised of multiple single neurons. They can be used in Supervised Learning for both Regression and Classification problems.

# Datasets

I used the Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras, which is a dataset that contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories:
0.  T-shirt/top
1.	Trouser
2.	Pullover
3.	Dress
4.	Coat
5.	Sandal
6.	Shirt
7.	Sneaker
8.	Bag
9.	Ankle boot

60,000 images are in the training set and 10,000 are in the test set.

# Libraries

The following packages are needed to reproduce my results:
