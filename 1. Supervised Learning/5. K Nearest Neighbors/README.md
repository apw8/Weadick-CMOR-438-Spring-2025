# K Nearest Neighbors

The K Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a nonparametric algorithm that assumes that similar data are near each other. This nearness is measured by a distance measure, which is Euclidean distance in this implementation. It predicts the target label by analyzing the 'k' closest data points to an input.

# Datasets

I used the palmer_penguins dataset, which is a dataset that contains information about the island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. It was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica.

# Libraries

The following packages are needed to reproduce my results:
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
