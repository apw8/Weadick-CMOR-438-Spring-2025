# Decision and Regression Trees

Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation. The basic goal of a decision tree is to split a population of data into smaller segments. They were named after their tree like structure and contain nodes and branches. There are even root nodes (the node at the start of the tree) and leaf nodes (final nodes where predictions are made).

# Datasets

I used the palmer_penguins dataset, which is a dataset that contains information about the island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. It was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica.
