# Random Forests

The Random Forest algorithm is an Ensemble Method used for both Regression and Classification problems. It builds on the concept of Decision Trees, combining multiple trees to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. Random Forests work by constructing a large number of decision trees during training and outputting either the mode for classification or the mean prediction for regression from the individual trees. It is part of the bagging family of algorithms, which aim to reduce variance and improve generalization.

# Datasets

I used the palmer_penguins dataset, which is a dataset that contains information about the island, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), and sex of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins. It was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica.
